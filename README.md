# Abortino Leg



The evolution of Abortino

Mini Quadruped bot 

## Getting Started


I use this awesome 3D printed [models](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38159) find on thingiverse, It is very minimalist but prints quickly.


It use the smal and cheap 9G servos.

With the model there is also the code but I'm having fun rewriting by myself.


## Project

I am planning to use a NodeMCU but for now I am doing tests using a Genuino Mega (I am using this as I had this)

You can see it in action
