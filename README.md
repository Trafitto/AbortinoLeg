# Abortino Leg



The evolution of Abortino

Mini Quadruped bot 

## Getting Started


I 3D printed this awesome [models](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38159) found on thingiverse, it is very minimalist but prints quickly.

It use the small and cheap 9G servos.

With the model there is also the code but I'm having fun rewriting by myself.


## Project

I am planning to use a NodeMCU but for now I am doing tests using a Genuino Mega because I have it.

You can see it in action
